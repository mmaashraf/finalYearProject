<h1> What Inspired this?</h1>

<div>
<p>
Liver diseases are one of the major causes of death in the world. We, humans, have come a long way in the medical field and scientific advancements to treat diseases and it's evident that when these liver diseases are detected early, they can be treated easily. In order to be able to accurately predict if there’s a chance of the liver disease it is imperative to identify the features/symptoms which play a significant role in causing the LD. It is crucial to select the correct combination of significant features as it will improve the performance of the prediction models.
We are proposing a system which will first identify the significant features and then use them to predict whether or not a person may suffer or is suffering from LD. Our system ought to be used as a supplementary tool in diagnosis. Data is essential and We will be using the dataset available on the UIC repository. We will be using genetic algorithms to identify the significant features and then use those features to train different classification models like k-Nearest Neighbors, k-means, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, etcetera which will predict if there’s a chance of LD for a person’s data. We will also be using neural networks with backpropagation to  perform binary classification.
Ideally our proposed solution should be able to identify the significant features and find the best model which will be able to predict with more accuracy or another statistical measure
